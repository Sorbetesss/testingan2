			As a consequence, there is no multi-threading because there is nothing to thread.
		2. Support for arbitrary and changeable state sizes.  Frequency is calculated dynamically.
		3. No delta compression.  Keep it simple.  If there are cores that benefit heavily from delta compression, we should
			maintain a separate rewinder alongside this one that is customized for those cores.
