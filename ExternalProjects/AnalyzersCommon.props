		This is a set of MSBuild imports rather than a project because I COULD NOT for the life of me get the latter to work.
		With the workaround given in dotnet/roslyn#61940, everything built, but then the main solution wouldn't build. Every project gave:
			warning CS8785: Generator 'VIMGenerator' failed to generate source. It will not contribute to the output and compilation errors may occur as a result.
			Exception was of type 'FileNotFoundException'
			with message 'Could not load file or assembly 'BizHawk.Analyzers.Common, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null'. The system cannot find the file specified.
		Yes, even with an EXPLICIT <Reference/> to the Common project's assembly. So you get this instead. â€”yoshi
